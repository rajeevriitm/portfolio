By formal education, I am a physics student. But I never enjoyed and passionately worked on a project like, when I worked for my websites.
 The moment I realized that this is where I belong, I dropped the research project I was doing and concentrated on
 understanding the fundamentals of web-development. My passion and the constant obsession to learn more, has taken me here.
 And a lot more to go...
