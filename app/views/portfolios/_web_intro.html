I am a full-stack web developer, working mostly on <b> Ruby on Rails </b> and <b> Node.js </b> platforms. I  graduated from <b> Indian Institute of Technology Madras </b> (IIT-M) in 2014.
I take up challenging yet interesting projects from different startups and well established companies and successfully finish them
as per the client's needs, in time.I do consulting for clients as well.</p>
<p>
 I am always on the look out for new technologies and tools ,
and very eager to learn and master them. As a freelancer I offer , productivity, efficiency , and trust and I expect
them in return.

I am also an occasional physicist. I do like to play with mathematical equations. If interested, you can take a look into
a research paper I co-authored, in the field of Quantum Optics.
