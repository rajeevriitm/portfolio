In my experiences. Most code faster but with lots of verifications and vallidation mistakes compared to the older programmers. But the advantages is that the young ones tend to take risk and apply new coding method so eventually, there are advantages on both. Old ones are least problematic when it comes back to UAT and coding space or remedy, but the young ones are more risky and lost themselves halfway if they are trying to finish the job too fast. Alot of over-confidence issues with the young and reluctant to learn new styles from the old. Combination works best. However, this is the natural cycle. So it is a challenge of still.. who is more logical.
